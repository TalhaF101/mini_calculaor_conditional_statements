# mini_calculaor_conditional_statements
This is a c++ program
The same program (mini_calculator) is coded using conditional statements (If, else)
This program is written usin if statements (nested)
Comparitively switch statements are a better approach as it is a more clean way to write a code for a particular problem
Nested ifs can be used if you are doing a simple program with less number of inputs
